🚀 Excited to share our open-source aerospace engine simulation platform!

We've built a production-ready system with interactive API demo:

✅ Multi-physics coupling (CFD, thermal, structural analysis)
✅ Real-time performance monitoring
✅ Enterprise-grade compliance (DO-178C, AS9100, NASA NPR 7150.2)
✅ 95% code coverage with comprehensive testing
✅ Interactive Swagger UI for easy API testing

Try the live demo: [YOUR-RENDER-URL]/swagger
GitHub: https://github.com/HelloblueAI/HelloblueGK

Built with .NET 9.0, fully open-source (Apache 2.0), and ready for research collaboration.

Looking forward to feedback from the aerospace engineering community! 🛰️
