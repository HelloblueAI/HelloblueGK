# Certification Action Plan: From Systems to Certification

## Current Status ✅

**What You Have:**
- ✅ Requirements Traceability System (live)
- ✅ Problem Reporting System (live)
- ✅ Configuration Management System (live)
- ✅ Test Coverage System (live)
- ✅ Code Review System (live)
- ✅ All systems integrated and working

**What You Need:**
- ⏳ Actual certification project/application
- ⏳ Complete documentation
- ⏳ 100% test coverage on real code
- ⏳ Certification consultant/DER
- ⏳ Authority engagement

## The Reality Check

**Important:** You cannot "apply for certification" like applying for a job. Certification happens as part of:
- **Aircraft certification** (DO-178C) - Your software is part of an aircraft/engine being certified
- **Mission approval** (NASA NPR 7150.2) - Your software is part of a NASA mission

**You need a specific application first:**
- What aircraft engine will use this software?
- What NASA mission will use this software?
- Certification follows the application, not the other way around

## Practical Path Forward

### Option 1: Partner with Aircraft Manufacturer (DO-178C)

**Steps:**
1. **Identify Partner**
   - Approach aircraft manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus, etc.)
   - Approach engine manufacturers (GE, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce)
   - Approach aerospace companies (Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman)

2. **Pitch Your Platform**
   - "We have certification-ready systems"
   - "We can support your DO-178C Level A development"
   - "Our platform handles requirements, testing, coverage, reviews"

3. **Get Contract**
   - Develop software for their aircraft/engine
   - Use your certification systems
   - Follow DO-178C processes
   - Certification happens as part of their aircraft certification

**Timeline:** 2-5 years
**Cost:** Partner covers most costs
**Benefit:** Real certification on real project

### Option 2: Partner with NASA (NPR 7150.2)

**Steps:**
1. **Identify Mission**
   - Look for NASA SBIR/STTR opportunities
   - Identify missions needing flight software
   - Approach NASA centers (JPL, Goddard, etc.)
