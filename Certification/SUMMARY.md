  - Change Control Board (CCB) process
  - Change request workflow
  - Software Configuration Index (SCI) generation
  - Configuration audits

#### 4. Test Coverage System ✅
- **Purpose:** Track 100% code coverage + MC/DC
- **Required for:** DO-178C Level A
- **Features:**
  - 100% statement coverage tracking
  - 100% branch coverage tracking
  - MC/DC coverage for safety-critical code
  - Coverage gap analysis
  - Compliance verification

#### 5. Formal Code Review System ✅
- **Purpose:** Track all code reviews with certified reviewers
- **Required for:** DO-178C Level A, NASA NPR 7150.2 Class A
- **Features:**
  - Certified reviewer assignments
  - Review findings tracking
  - Review approval workflow
  - Compliance verification

#### 6. Documentation Templates ✅
- Software Requirements Document (SRD) template
- Software Design Document (SDD) template

### Path Forward
1. **Immediate (Weeks 1-8):** Database setup, API integration, Web UI
2. **Short-term (Months 2-6):** Integration, coverage achievement
3. **Medium-term (Months 6-18):** Process implementation, IV&V
4. **Long-term (Months 18-30):** Certification review and approval

## Bottom Line

**YES - We're building a certified flight system!**

All the foundational systems required for DO-178C Level A and NASA NPR 7150.2 Class A certification are now in place. The next steps are:

1. Set up databases
2. Create APIs
3. Build management UIs
4. Integrate with codebase
5. Achieve 100% coverage
6. Execute certification process

**Timeline:** 2.5 years to full certification  
**Status:** Foundation complete, ready for implementation
